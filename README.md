# Mini-Alexa for Pdf

Nature loves symmetry.**"Read Out Loud"** feature of Adobe Acrobat reader or Microsoft Bing Pdf reader produces one-way text-to-speech feature.<br>
Being a voracious audio listener myself, an ability to interact with Pdf while listening to Pdf reader  like move to previous paragraph , pause reading , start reading , highligh lines etc. are nice feature to have.<br>
To do so , speech-to-text feature has been added in order to understand commands.<br>
Development of _GUI application, Pdf Viewer , text-to-speech_ achieved using various python open-source libary [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI), [PyMupdf](https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF) , [pyttsx3](https://github.com/nateshmbhat/pyttsx3) and speech command recognition using **Snowboy API**. A big shoutout to the those incredible developers.

## Note

Currently development is active for linux as Snowboy is not supported on Windows.
